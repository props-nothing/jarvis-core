# Foundation evidence through 2026-10-16

Archived on 2026-10-16 from the implementation ledger. This preserves the original dated claims, failures, corrections and unchecked items; it is **not current delivery status or work order**. Later entries and accepted ADRs may supersede earlier statements. Use the [active backlog](../../TODO.md) and [history index](README.md) for current disposition. Relative Markdown links were adjusted when this material moved.

---

## Working Rules

- Select the first unchecked task whose dependencies are complete.
- Keep one behavioral slice in progress at a time.
- Complete required research before selecting a dependency or writing an external adapter.
- A compile-only implementation is not complete when the task describes runtime behavior.
- Use [definition-of-done.md](../development/definition-of-done.md) for every item.

## P2: Safe Conversation

<a id="p2-001"></a>

- [x] `P2-001` Research and record the selected first model API and SDK version.
      Record: `docs/research/integrations/openai-compatible-model-api.md`. Selected transport is
      `POST /v1/chat/completions` (Chat Completions), not the Responses API, because Responses is
      interoperable with self-hosted servers only in its non-stateful subset. No SDK: OpenAI publishes
      no official Rust library, so the adapter speaks HTTP directly.
<a id="p2-002"></a>

- [x] `P2-002` Define provider-neutral model request, response, stream-event, usage, capability, and normalized error contracts.
      Implemented in the new `crates/jarvis-models` crate: `ChatRequest`/`ChatMessage`/`ContentPart`,
      `ChatResponse`/`FinishReason`/`ToolCall`, `StreamEvent`/`StreamEnvelope`/`StreamValidator`,
      `TokenUsage`, `ModelCapabilities`/`Support`/`Placement`, `ModelError`/`ModelErrorKind`, and the
      `ModelGateway` port. Quota and billing failures map to `PermanentUpstream` because they are not
      retryable. No HTTP client or provider SDK is in the dependency graph yet.
<a id="p2-003"></a>

- [x] `P2-003` Implement one OpenAI-compatible model adapter with bounded retries, cancellation, timeouts, and secret-safe diagnostics.
      Implemented in `crates/jarvis-models/src/openai/`: a provider adapter against a `Transport` port,
      `reqwest` 0.13.5 (rustls) as the implementation, an incremental SSE decoder, a bounded retry
      policy that honours `Retry-After`, and validated credential/URL types. 16 offline contract tests
      replay scripted provider bytes, so the default suite performs no network I/O. Proxies, redirects,
      and insecure TLS are disabled because each default fails open for private content. A live smoke
      test against a real provider is deliberately not included and is not claimed.
<a id="p2-004"></a>

- [x] `P2-004` Define and migrate sessions, messages, agent runs, agent steps, model calls, and usage records.
      Migration `0003_conversation_state.sql` adds `users`, `workspaces`, `sessions`, `messages`,
      `agent_runs`, `agent_steps`, and `model_calls` (schema version 3). Usage is recorded inline on
      `agent_runs` as a run summary and on `model_calls` per call; `docs/data/schema.md` defines no
      separate usage table, and a duplicate total could disagree with its parts. Seven constraint tests
      prove the invariants are enforced by SQLite rather than only documented: duplicate message
      sequence, orphan foreign key, terminal run without an outcome, unknown run state, optimistic
      concurrency (exactly one writer advances a run), failed call without an error code, and an unknown
      sensitivity level. Also added the `jarvis_core::Sensitivity` vocabulary, which five documents
      referenced but none defined.
<a id="p2-005"></a>

- [x] `P2-005` Implement the native run state machine with explicit legal transitions and optimistic concurrency.
      `jarvis_core::run` owns the transition table as data (`RunState`, `RunOutcome`,
      `RunTransition`, `ExpectedRunState`); `jarvis_storage::run_repository` makes it durable in
      `agent_runs`. Legality is decided in the domain and the *comparison* is decided by a single
      `UPDATE ... WHERE id = ? AND state = ? AND version = ?`, so a lost update is not
      representable. The write path is a real repository used by tests against a real SQLite
      database, and the concurrency guard has a falsification test in which two callers hold the
      same expectation and exactly one wins. Three documented gaps were closed rather than
      implemented around: `awaiting_approval` is cancellable but **not** failable (nothing can
      fail while a human decides), and `responding -> failed`/`cancelled` were missing from the
      diagram, which left a generation failure with `completed` as its only legal successor.
      Cancellation is recorded as a *request* that does not settle the run, matching A04.
<a id="p2-006"></a>

- [x] `P2-006` Implement context envelopes with source, sensitivity, token budget, and inclusion reason.
      `jarvis_core::context` defines `ContextItem`, `ContextSourceKind`, `ContextTrust`,
      `ContextPriority`, `InclusionReason`, `ContextBudget`, and `assemble_context`, with a
      manifest that accounts for every offered item and reports instruction and external token
      totals separately. Two contract fields are enforced rather than recorded: only
      `Authoritative` content may instruct the model, and untrusted content must be quoted, so
      external content labelled as policy is rejected at construction rather than at the
      assembly step. The step-1 budget reservation is arithmetic rather than ordering advice:
      retrieved content draws only on the unreserved remainder. 24 tests, including one that
      falsified a real defect in the first implementation, where required and retrieved
      spending shared one counter and silently evicted retrieval results that fitted.
      Also fixed four stale `database_schema: 2` fixture literals in `jarvis-protocol` left
      behind by the round-2 schema bump to version 3.
<a id="p2-007a"></a>

- [x] `P2-007a` Research the selected Rust HTTP server framework and fix the gateway boundary.
      Record: `docs/research/integrations/rust-http-server-and-sse.md`. Selected **axum 0.8.9**
      (MIT, MSRV 1.80), pinned exactly because `main` is mid-0.9 and documented as breaking.
      The deciding evidence is reuse rather than novelty: `hyper` 1.11.1, `http` 1.5.0,
      `tower` 0.5.3, and `tower-http` 0.6.11 are **already resolved** through `reqwest` 0.13.5,
      so this adds ~3 packages instead of a parallel HTTP stack. Also recorded: `DefaultBodyLimit`
      defaults to 2 MB and is local rather than global; `Sse::keep_alive` needs the `tokio`
      feature and defaults off; `axum::serve` never returns an error and retries socket errors
      itself, which contradicts this daemon's fail-fast listener. Boundary fixed by
      `docs/adr/0011-run-events-and-http-transport.md`: HTTP is a first-class peer transport to
      local IPC, routing lives in `apps/jarvisd`, REST DTOs in `jarvis-protocol`, and
      `jarvis-core`/`jarvis-application`/`jarvis-storage` stay framework-free.
<a id="p2-007b"></a>

- [x] `P2-007b` Persist an ordered, sequence-numbered run-event record.
      Migration `0004_run_events.sql` (schema version 4) adds `run_events` with
      `UNIQUE (run_id, sequence)`. `jarvis_core::run_event` owns `RunEventKind`,
      `RunEventSequence`, `EventSummary`, `RunEventPayload`, and `ReplayRequest` (10 tests);
      `jarvis_storage::run_event_repository` makes it durable (13 tests). Two guards are
      falsified rather than asserted: a settled run cannot emit another event, and a stored
      stream that continues after a terminal event is reported rather than replayed. The
      append is ONE `INSERT ... SELECT` that allocates its own sequence, because the
      read-then-insert form fails with `SQLITE_BUSY_SNAPSHOT` when two writers race. Also
      fixed the schema-bump fixture trap this change re-triggered: `inspect.rs` hard-coded
      `user_version = 3` twice and asserted `Inconsistent { user_version: 3 }`, which the
      documented rule predicted. Those now derive from `CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`.
<a id="p2-007"></a>

- [x] `P2-007` Add `POST /api/v1/runs`, run status, cancel, and SSE activity/output streams.
      Depends on `P2-007a` and `P2-007b`. Both are prerequisites rather than parallel work:
      the SSE contract requires replay from durable records (`docs/architecture/protocols.md`),
      and a server framework is a new dependency that `docs/development/external-research.md`
      requires be researched before adapter code is written.
      **Delivered:** REST DTOs in `jarvis-protocol/src/rest.rs` (requests `deny_unknown_fields`,
      responses additive-tolerant, every failure reusing the v1 `WireError` envelope); the
      authenticated router in `apps/jarvisd/src/gateway.rs` with the body limit applied as a
      router layer so a later route cannot omit it; run use cases in `run_service.rs`; the SSE
      stream in `sse.rs` driven by a `Last-Event-ID` sequence cursor over the durable log, with
      keep-alives as **comment** frames rather than `heartbeat` events (a heartbeat event would
      occupy a sequence number and enter the log). Storage side: `SessionId`/`RunId`/
      `SessionChannel`/`SessionStatus` in the domain, and `session_repository::start_run`, which
      writes the session, the run, and the run's first event in **one** transaction because
      three calls could leave a run whose stream is empty — indistinguishable from a run whose
      events were lost. The HTTP transport is separately enabled
      (`daemon.http_enabled`, `JARVIS_HTTP_ENABLED`, default off), loopback-only, and bound
      *before* serving, with the serving task's completion as a third `select!` branch, because
      `axum::serve` never returns an error and so cannot report its own death.
      **Two real defects were found by the tests rather than by reading:** the bearer extractor
      trimmed whitespace and therefore accepted a padded token, and
      `GET /runs/{id}/stream` answered `200` for a run that did not exist, because
      `highest_run_event_sequence` returns `None` for both "no run" and "run with no events".
      **Honest limits:** this slice is a *transport*, not an executor. Nothing invokes a model,
      so a run reaches `received` and stays there until `P2-009` supplies an adapter.
      `idempotency_key` is refused with `Unsupported` rather than silently ignored, because no
      deduplication ledger exists and ignoring it would tell a retrying client its request was
      deduplicated while two runs had in fact been created.
<a id="p2-008"></a>

- [x] `P2-008` Add CLI `ask` and `chat` using the daemon API; the CLI must contain no orchestration logic.
      **Delivered:** `jarvis ask <objective...>`, which starts a run through `POST /api/v1/runs`,
      consumes `GET /api/v1/runs/{id}/stream`, and renders the run. The client is transport only:
      it sends an objective and no identity, because the workspace and user are resolved by the
      daemon from its seeded local rows. New code: `crates/jarvis-core/src/loopback.rs`
      (`LoopbackHost`, whose host is unrepresentable so a client cannot be aimed off loopback),
      `crates/jarvis-protocol/src/run_api.rs` (request paths with a refused unsafe segment, and a
      hand-written SSE decoder matching the decision already recorded for the model adapter), and
      `apps/jarvis-cli/src/{api_client,chat}.rs`. Two exit statuses were added so a script cannot
      read a cancelled (`9`) or failed (`10`) run as success.
      **One real defect was found by running it, not by testing it:** the client set a *client-level*
      `reqwest` timeout, which bounds the whole response body, so every SSE stream was killed at the
      deadline while every non-streaming call worked. The timeout is now applied per non-streaming
      request, and only `read_timeout` bounds a stream.
      **`chat` was deliberately NOT built here.** It needs a session that persists across turns and a
      model that answers; neither existed until `P2-009`, so a chat loop at that point could only print
      a `received` run per turn — a conversation that records nothing. This item therefore shipped
      `ask` alone and `chat` was carried by `P2-009`, which is where it was built as `P2-009b`. This
      entry is checked because `ask` is delivered and `chat` is no longer outstanding, not because
      `chat` was part of this change.
<a id="p2-009"></a>

- [x] `P2-009` Build a scripted model adapter for deterministic state, retry, stream, and cancellation tests.
      **Conversation persistence is done, which closes the A03 half that needed no model:** the
      `messages` table existed since `P2-004` but had **no production writer** — only test fixtures
      inserted rows, so an accepted user message was not recorded at all. `jarvis_core::message` now
      defines the stored vocabulary and `jarvis_storage::message_repository` is the writer, with the
      sequence allocated by the inserting statement because `UNIQUE (session_id, sequence)` makes a
      read-then-insert collide (a test races eight appends and asserts eight contiguous positions).
      The user's message is written **in the same transaction as the run it triggers**, and the
      assistant's answer is read back from the run's own `output_completed` event rather than held in
      memory, so the transcript and the event stream cannot disagree.
      Also carries the `jarvis chat` loop from `P2-008`: a multi-turn chat needs a model that answers
      and a session read model, both of which this slice must supply.
      **In progress — the adapter is done, the executor is not.** `crates/jarvis-models/src/scripted.rs`
      implements the **same** `ModelGateway` port as the real provider adapter, so a consumer cannot
      tell a scripted run from a live one except by what it was told to do: `Turn` scripts answer,
      fragment, fail with a normalized error, or delay so a cancellation can race them. Ten tests
      assert the sequence contract (`0..n`, contiguous, terminal last), that a dropped event is
      reported as a gap by `StreamValidator`, that the last turn repeats so an over-call is a visible
      call count rather than an error, that a cancellation arriving *during* a turn reports `Cancelled`
      and not a timeout, and that the port works through a trait object.
      It is deliberately **not** `#[cfg(test)]` and not a mock: the daemon must be able to run it for
      the first end-to-end run, and a mock-only path is what `definition-of-done.md` forbids calling
      complete. It is not reachable from configuration, so it cannot be selected by accident.
      **Remaining for this slice:** the executor that drives a run through `jarvis-models` and writes
      each step to `run_events`, which is what makes a run reach a terminal state and therefore what
      `A03`/`A04` need. That is the next round, and it also unblocks `jarvis chat` and the `jarvis ask`
      stall guard's replacement (a settled run).
      **Its storage prerequisite is done:** `jarvis_storage::settle_run` writes a terminal transition and
      its settlement event in one transaction. The two existing primitives are individually correct but
      had **no valid order** — transitioning first makes the event append fail
      (`RunEventAfterSettlement`), and appending first records a settlement for a run that has not
      settled. Four tests, including one that writes out the two-call form and asserts it is refused, so
      the reason the primitive exists is falsifiable. `RunState::terminal_event_kind` is the one place
      the state-to-event mapping lives.
      **The executor is done:** `apps/jarvisd/src/executor.rs` drives a run from `received` to a terminal
      state, and it lives in that composition root because `repository-layout.md` allows
      `jarvis-application` to depend only on `jarvis-core` with no arrow into an adapter. It assembles
      context (recording the manifest as audit evidence), calls the model through the `ModelGateway`
      port, appends one event per answer fragment, records usage, and settles. Selected by the new
      `daemon.executor_model` / `JARVIS_EXECUTOR_MODEL`, resolved **at startup** so an unimplemented name
      stops the daemon rather than being found when the first run starts.
      **Verified live, and running it found three real defects plus one in `P2-008`:**
      1. the loop re-settled an already-settled run, which the domain refused as
         `TerminalStateImmutable { from: Failed }` — anything but an error about settlement ordering;
      2. `assemble_context` was called with a ceiling that **excluded** the objective, and the objective
         was then sent to the model anyway. The ceiling is now derived from the model's declared
         placement, so the assembled context and the request agree;
      3. a cancellation requested during a model call bumps `version` without changing `state`, so the
         executor's next guarded write failed with a spurious `RunConflict`. Writes now re-read first;
         **CORRECTION (2026-09-23): re-reading first was necessary but not sufficient, and it was not the
         last word on this.** `P3-008j` found the same test failing under load again, because the
         cancellation itself still bumped `version` and invalidated the expectation the executor was
         holding across a model call. The fix is that a write changing no state does not advance the
         version at all (ADR-0022 decision 7). See the `P3-008j` entry for the deterministic test that
         replaced "it passed a few times".
      4. **`P2-008`'s client printed the answer twice**, because it rendered `output_delta` and
         `output_completed` identically and the completed event repeats every fragment. The two kinds
         are now distinct readings, with a test asserting they differ.
      A live run now completes in about a second with the answer on stdout and progress on stderr, and a
      bad model name fails closed with an actionable message.
      **This slice is complete.** The two things it said it would carry are done: the executor drives a
      run to a terminal state, and conversation persistence means an accepted user message and the
      answer that resulted are both recorded, with the answer read back from the run's own
      `output_completed` event rather than held in memory.
      **The `jarvis chat` loop it carried is built**, in the slice below.
<a id="p2-009b"></a>

- [x] `P2-009b` Build the multi-turn `jarvis chat` loop, carrying the `chat` half of `P2-008`.
      **Delivered:** a conversation is a sequence of **runs sharing one session**. `jarvis chat` reads
      a turn per line, starts a run in the session the daemon issued on the first turn, and prints it,
      so the earlier turns are replayed by the daemon rather than by the client. New pieces:
      - `jarvis_storage::SessionTarget` (`New` | `Existing`) and `StartRunInput::continuing`, so
        "start a conversation" and "continue one" are distinguishable rather than both being an
        optional identifier. The session predicate — `workspace_id`, `user_id`, `status = 'active'` —
        is folded into the `UPDATE` that attaches the run, not checked afterwards, because a session
        identifier is guessable and a caller must not be able to append to a conversation it was never
        granted. A refusal is resolved on the failure path into `SessionNotFound` (absent, or another
        identity's — reported as absent so its existence is not confirmed) or `SessionNotWritable`
        (archived, which means "start a new conversation" rather than "the identifier was wrong").
      - `jarvis_storage::{read_recent_messages, count_messages}`. The history window is selected from
        the **end** of the transcript, because a follow-up depends on the turns closest to it: reading
        the first N and reversing them returns the *oldest* turns, which is the obvious mistake here
        and the one the test names.
      - `StartRunRequest.session_id` (optional; absent means a new conversation) and
        `ApiClient::start_run_in_session`.
      - The executor loads the session's history, offers it to **the context assembler** rather than
        adding it to the request directly, and builds the request from the resulting manifest.
      - `ScriptedModel::seen_messages()` records every request served, because a conversation is a
        property of the *request*: a daemon that sent only the latest question would satisfy every
        assertion about the answer.
      **Running the new test found a real defect the design had wrong.** `messages_from_manifest`
      walked the manifest and produced `policy, current question, earlier question, earlier answer`,
      because the assembler orders by **budget tier** — required content first — and the objective is
      required while history is optional. That order is right for budgeting and wrong for a
      conversation: a model reading the earlier exchange *after* the current question sees it as a
      continuation of the prompt rather than as context for it. Fixed by separating the two questions:
      the manifest decides **what may be sent** (so an excluded turn is absent by construction) and
      the conversation decides **in what order** (policy, then replayed turns oldest-first, then the
      question).
      **Verified live:** two turns against a real daemon produced two runs in one session
      (`run …4cee-772d… session …d915c4c7…`, then `run …4f05-70f6… session …d915c4c7…`), both
      `completed`, with the second turn replayed from the first.
      **Honest limits:** the session's history is replayed as text, so a tool result is skipped rather
      than replayed (a tool message needs the call it answers, and nothing writes one yet); the
      twelve-turn window is bounded because a transcript grows without limit and a model's context
      does not, and a turn the budget cannot hold is excluded **with a recorded reason**; and
      `jarvis chat` has no resume-by-identifier, so a conversation continues within one process —
      `P4-008` adds the inspect and export surface that would make a stored conversation reachable
      again.
<a id="p2-010"></a>

- [x] `P2-010` Prove restart behavior at every persisted run boundary and pass the Phase 2 gate.
      **Delivered:** restart truthfulness, and the Phase 2 process gate that proves it against the real
      binaries.
      `jarvis_storage::recover_interrupted_runs` settles every non-terminal run at startup: `cancelled`
      when a cancellation had already been requested (the operator's intent outranks the interruption),
      otherwise `failed` with `error_code = interrupted_by_restart`. Each settlement writes the terminal
      state and its terminal event in **one transaction** through `settle_run`, so a client replaying
      the stream sees it exactly once; it is the second place that primitive is required, which is the
      evidence ADR-0011 wanted. Tests cover every non-terminal boundary in a loop rather than one
      convenient state, a cancelled-before-restart run, idempotence of a second pass, and a clean profile
      recovering nothing — 99 storage tests.
      The daemon calls it **before the listener binds**, so no client can observe a run the daemon has
      not accounted for, logs the identifiers it recovered rather than a bare count, and treats failure
      as fatal: a daemon unable to explain its own interrupted work must not serve.
      `tests/e2e/tests/phase2_gate.rs` is the Phase 2 exit gate as a process test. It runs the real
      `jarvisd` and `jarvis`, starts runs through the public API, kills the daemon with two runs in
      flight, and asserts the restarted daemon settled the abandoned run `failed` with
      `interrupted_by_restart`, settled the cancelled one `cancelled`, that each gained exactly one
      terminal event, that the recovery is in the log with its identifiers, that a fresh run streams to
      `run_completed`, and that `jarvis ask` reaches the same API. It is wired into CI for all three
      operating systems.
      **Recovery is truthfulness, not resumption**, and ADR-0013 records why: the model stream and the
      answer text live in the executor's memory and the daemon cannot know whether an in-flight provider
      call was accepted, so a resume could present a second answer to a question already being answered.
      `A03` offers that either/or and the second branch is taken deliberately.
      **Three defects were found by running it, none by the unit suites:**
      1. the gate could not write `config.toml` because its directory did not exist — it was relying on
         the daemon to create the file the daemon reads;
      2. `reqwest` panicked with "there is no reactor running" because the gate drove HTTP through
         `Runtime::block_on` from a synchronous body. Neither `block_on` nor entering the runtime around
         it gives the request builder a runtime context; making the gate genuinely `async` removes the
         distinction instead of papering over it;
      3. **the falsification run passed.** Disabling recovery and rerunning the gate reported success,
         because `cargo test` does not rebuild the binary the test executes — it ran the previous
         `jarvisd`. Rebuilding first made the gate fail exactly as it should ("a run interrupted by a
         restart must be reported as failed", with the run still `received`), which is why CI rebuilds
         the workspace before each gate.
